A simple program for installing WineGE.

## Why?

Simple, because when I used ProtonUpQT the installation was stuck at 33%.

### Why should I use it?

- Its lightweight
- Its not written in Python, but instead in Go
- Its minimalistic
- It has a TUI instead of GUI(if you like it that way)
- Its fast!
- It compiles in matter of seconds too!
